# P.2108 Comparison Tool

**Disclaimer: This software repository acts as an active workspace in support of on-going discussions that are occuring at the 2023 ITU-R Study Group 3 meetings.  This work should not be considered production-level software.  Software releases are best-of-effort attempts to augment conversations, recognizing that normal software quality checks such as code-reviews and unit testing is purposefully being skipped in order for the software to keep up with the discussions.**

This codebase attempts to create a simple tool to allow users to generate a variety of curve sets comparing the current in-force Recommendation ITU-R P.2108-1, Section 3.3 clutter model with proposed updates.
