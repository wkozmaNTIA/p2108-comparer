# P.2108 Comparison Tool

**Disclaimer: This software repository has been made available as an active workspace in support of on-going discussions during the 2023 ITU-R Study Group 3 meetings. The work presented here represents a preliminary analysis in draft form. Software releases in this repository are best-effort attempts to augment conversation and support collaboration and data sharing in the context of NTIA's scientific culture that values Open Science and holds that openness in science is fundamental to scientific and research integrity. The contents of this repository are provided solely for the purposes of collaboration in research and development; nothing in this repository has undergone ITS standard quality review procedures such as code-reviews and unit testing and this is not production-level software.**

This codebase attempts to create a simple tool to allow users to generate a variety of curve sets comparing the current in-force Recommendation ITU-R P.2108-1, Section 3.3 clutter model with proposed updates.
